Generate procedural terrains in Unity.  This is not intended to be a replacement for any of the feature rich terrain generators on the Asset Store. It's intended for easy prototyping. The terrains adequate and, with a bit of work, maybe even useful.

## Getting Started

Setup a Digital Painting scene as per normal process.

Add the Terrain Plugin to your scene.

Ensure that the terrain plugin is configured correctly. There are a couple of sample setups (Hills_ProceduralTerrain_PrefabSO and Mountains_ProceduralTerrain_PrefabSO) to get you started.

You should have a warning at this point that the terrain does not exist in the scene. Click the "Instantiate Prefab" button and a terrain will be generated for you

## Original Source

This project has its roots in [Sebastian Lague's Procedureal Landmass Generator](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Landmass-Generation) available on GitHub. If you are interested in how it works then you should check out his excellent tutorial [Series Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3). Check out his other videos too, there is some really good stuff on there.

Thank you Sebastian.
